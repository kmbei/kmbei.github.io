ADB is involved with the development of zoning analysis, initial planning and 
numerous schematic designs for this new proposed 10 storeys building renovation.<p>
<br>
This existing seven storeys office building is currently occupied with the 
community center on first three floors. ADB met with Corps Officers and users of 
the spaces, redesigned the community center and provided the Corps with new 
operational efficient layouts and flexible as well as multiple use of space.<p>
<br>
The existing offices located on the fourth through seventh floors are being 
converted into residential apartments for Corps’ officers. An addition of three 
floors is being constructed to provide additional residential spaces.<br>
